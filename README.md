# Installing and using with AUTOMATIC1111's SD webui
To install simply download the `Camilla-FE.bin` file and place it in your `stable-diffusion-webui-master\embeddings` folder. Then in order to use the embedding enter in the filename `Camilla-FE.bin` or the token `<Camilla-FE>` in the prompt field. (You can download SD webui [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) )



# Model details

15-16 512x512 pixel images were used to train the textual inversion embed.

* 2D anime/cartoon/digital art style
* front facing view (1 or 2 were from the side)
* contained camilla's face, purple hair, and breasts

This was trained with the google collab for textual inversion and **not** the webui version. This means I couldn't add tags. If you'd like to retrain the model with appropriate tags on the inputs you have my blessing (but please share the final result).


# Why?

I am incredibly horny for Camilla.
